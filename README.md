Image processing utility whose main goal is to help me to choose 'right images' from huge set of images performing some magic.

Main goal is to make myself common with C++ and some common image processing algorithms.

Note: No OpenCV was used, the only external dependency is [stb\_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h).


# Installation
1. run `make`
2. run `./right_image`
